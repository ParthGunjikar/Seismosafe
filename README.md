# Seismosafe

## Introduction
SeismoSafe is an innovative system designed to detect seismic waves in real time and provide immediate alerts to enhance safety during and after earthquake events. By leveraging affordable components and advanced communication methods, this project offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for communities in earthquake-prone regions.

SeismoSafe not only detects seismic activity but also addresses post-earthquake hazards such as gas leaks and fires. With features like mesh networking, localized alerts, and emergency SOS communication, SeismoSafe aims to minimize risks and save lives.
## Overview
SeismoSafe integrates the following technologies to provide a comprehensive safety network:

Real-Time Seismic Detection using the ADXL335 accelerometer.

Local Alert Systems including audible buzzers and OLED displays.

Mesh Networking with XBee modules for robust communication.

Emergency Communication via GSM for sending SOS messages.

Post-Earthquake Hazard Mitigation with MQ-2 gas sensors for gas leak detection.

The system processes sensor data locally, transmits it to neighboring nodes or a central hub, and triggers alarms when thresholds are exceeded. By providing both localized and centralized responses, SeismoSafe ensures effective and timely interventions.
