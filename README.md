## Introduction
SeismoSafe is an innovative system designed to detect seismic waves in real time and provide immediate alerts to enhance safety during and after earthquake events. By leveraging affordable components and advanced communication methods, this project offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for communities in earthquake-prone regions.

SeismoSafe not only detects seismic activity but also addresses post-earthquake hazards such as gas leaks and fires. With features like mesh networking, localized alerts, and emergency SOS communication, SeismoSafe aims to minimize risks and save lives.
